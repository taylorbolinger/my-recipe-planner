# 🍽️ MyRecipePlanner

MyRecipePlanner is a simple, stylish, and responsive recipe manager that lets users add, view, search, edit, and delete their favorite meals — all stored in their own browser. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

This project was created as a front-end portfolio piece to demonstrate UI development, responsive design, and dynamic client-side functionality.
